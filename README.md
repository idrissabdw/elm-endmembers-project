# Endmembers estimation with hyperspectral images
Estimation of endmembers of hyperspectral images

## Authors:
- Idriss ABDOULWAHAB

## Description:
This project aims to use the ELM method from B. Luo et al. 2013 to estimate the number of endmembers.

## Project Structure:
- **empirical_method.ipynb**: Contains the notebook that compute the ELM method
- **elm_algorithm.py**: Contains the algorithm to compute endmembers for all dataset with ELM method


## Dataset:
- The dataset is from B. Koirala et al., "A Multisensor Hyperspectral Benchmark Dataset For Unmixing of Intimate Mixtures," in IEEE Sensors Journal, doi: 10.1109/JSEN.2023.3343552
- Repository of the dataset : https://github.com/VisionlabHyperspectral/Multisensor_datasets
