# Endmembers estimation of hyperspectral images with ELM method
Estimation of endmembers of hyperspectral images by using the ELM method.

## Authors:

## Description:
This project aims to use the ELM method. Also known as the Eigenvalue Likelihood Maximization, this method is used to estimate endmembers of mixtured samples.
This method will we use had been describe in the paper from B. Luo et al. 2013.

## Project Structure:
- **empirical_method.ipynb**: Contains the notebook that compute the ELM method
- **elm_algorithm.py**: Contains the algorithm to compute endmembers for all dataset with ELM method


## Dataset:
- The dataset is from B. Koirala et al., "A Multisensor Hyperspectral Benchmark Dataset For Unmixing of Intimate Mixtures," in IEEE Sensors Journal, doi: 10.1109/JSEN.2023.3343552
- Repository of the dataset : https://github.com/VisionlabHyperspectral/Multisensor_datasets
